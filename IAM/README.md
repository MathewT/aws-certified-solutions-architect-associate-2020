# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Identity**
  * User of resources
  * "Who is the user?"
  * Authentication

**Access Management**
  * Authorization
  
AWS IAM manages **users** and their level of access to the AWS console.  

## Main Features
1. Centralized control of the AWS account
1. Shared access to the AWS account.  Grant other identities permission to administer the account and/or use resources 
**without sharing keys or passwords**
1. Granular permissions to specific users (identities) to specifc services and levels for services
1. Identity Federation.  Federate non-AWS user identities including identities from 
Facebook, Active Directory, LinkedIn, etc.) to your AWS account.  Grant temporary access to these federated identities 
to access the AWS account.
1. Identity information for assurance using CloudTrail.   Track which identities made requests for resources.
1. Multifactor Authentication for console access
1. Temporary access to resources.  E.g allow web or mobile users temporary access to DynamoDb or S3 to store data.  
1. PCI/DSS compliance.   Compliance required for services accepting online payments and storing credit card data

## Eventually Consistent
1. Changes made via IAM to identity or resource permissions are "eventually consistent"
1. Changes take time to fully replicate and take effect

## Accessing IAM
1. AWS Management Console
1. AWS CLI
1. AWS SDK
1. IAM HTTPS API
  * All requests must be digitally signed (requires code) with authorized credentials

## First Time Access:  Root Account Credentials
1. Creating an AWS account results in the creation of "root" identity which is used to sign-in into the AWS console
1. *Root account credentials:* email and password
1. Complete, unrestricted access to all resources including billing
1. **Best Practice:** Do not use root account for day-to-day management
1. **Best Practice:** Do not share root account credentials


## IAM Users
1. Users are AWS identities associated to people who access the console or account resources
1. IAM is universal, does not apply to regions
1. New users have NO permissions when first created, cannot access any resources
1. New users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access Key when first created
1. **Best Practice:** Always setup Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root account
1. Each user can have their own password for Console access
1. Each user can have their own access key for programmatic access to resources within the account
1. Users can be non-human machine users
1. IAM users **can not** view the canonical user ID of the AWS account, only the root user can

## Federating Existing Users
1. Users with identities owned/established by other systems can have those identities *federated* into the AWS account
1. The AWS user/identity who has already logged can still have their identity federated - their IAM user identity is 
replaced with a temporary identity within the AWS account
1. This *federated user* can then work with the AWS Console

### Useful Federation Scenarios
1. IAM users already have identities in a corporate directory
  1. Corporate directory is compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0)
  1. Configure the corp directory to provide single sign-on (SSO) access to the AWS Management Console 
  for users.  
  1. Or, if the corporate directory is Microsoft Active Directory use AWS Directory Service to establish trust between 
  the corporate directory and the AWS account
  1. Or, create an identity broker application to provide SSO access to the AWS Management Console via *custom federation broker*
1. IAM users already have Internet identities 
  1. Use any OpenId Connect (OIDC) compatible interent identity provider (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) to allow 
  users to identify themselves for access to AWS
  1. **Best Practice:** Use Amazon Cognito for identity federation with Internet identity providers

## Groups

A group is a collection of users under one set of permissions (policies)

## Policy Documents and Policies
1. A policy document in JSON format (Attribute/value pairs) in which you define a collection of **permissions** (1 or more)
1. The policy document is the basic tool for granting permissions in IAM
1. Any actions that are not explicitly allowed are denied by default
1. **User-based policy:** 
  * The policy document specifies the actions permitted and the specific resource
  * The policy can be *attached* to users, groups or roles individually
1. **Resource-based policy:**
  * Specify what actions are permitted (Effect:, Action:) and the specific resource (Resource)
  * Specify *who* can access the resource (Principal)
  * ```"Principal": {" AWS": "arn:aws:iam:: 777788889999: user/ bob"}```
  * Attach the policy to an AWS account resource (e.g. S3 bucket)
1. A **Principal** is an AWS entity that can perform actions and access resources

**Example policy document:**
```
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", 
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow", 
    "Action": "dynamodb:*", 
    "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2: 123456789012:table/Books" 
  }
}
```
This policy grants permission to perform all DynamoDB operations on the Books table in the specified account.

## IAM Roles
1. A role is an AWS identity with permission policies (access to actions and resources) that determine what the identity 
can and cannot do in AWS
1. Roles allow AWS services to interact with each other (e.g. EC2 application can access an S3 bucket or DynamoDB table)
1. Unlike IAM users, IAM roles do not identify a specific user 
1. Roles can be used (**"assumed"**) by a user or resource (EC2, Lambda)
1. Roles have no credentials (password or access key)
1. If a user is assigned to (assuming) a role, access keys are created dynamically and assigned to that user
1. Permissions are attached to the role
1. IAM roles can be attached to:
  * An IAM user in the same account as the role or different account as the role
  * A web or other resource offered by AWS such as EC2, Lambda, ...
  * An external user authenticated by an OIDC OpenId internet identity provider or SAML 2.0 compatible service
1. Roles are used to delegate access (permissions) to users, applications or services that don't normally have access 
to AWS resources
1. You create roles and assign to users or resources
1. Assign an IAM role to EC2 instance so instance apps can access S3 or DynamoDB
1. Assign an IAM role to a Lambda so the Lambda can access S3 or DynamoDB
1. You can grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another AWS account.
1. Delegate access to AWS resources via IAM role:
  * Allow a mobile app access to AWS resources without embedding key/secret
  * Give access to AWS resources to users with identities outside AWS
1. Roles are the primary and proper way to grant *cross-account access*

**Common Scenarios for Roles:**

1. IAM console users in an account can temporarily switch to a role and use the permissions of that role in the console.  
Users give up their own permissions while they take on the permissions of the role.  Original permissions are restored 
when the user exits the temporary role.
1. An AWS app or service such as EC2 can *assume* a role for which to make programmatic requests to AWS services
